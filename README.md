# Data-pagination-and-filtering

This is my project 2 for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree (Treehouse). With an initial list of 42 students, including name, email, and picture I applied JavaScript skills learned to display the first nine students on the page. I also added pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.


#### Knowledge used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript


#### Extra Features

 * Added Additional search bar and pagination for search results.
 * The number of pages and pagination buttons change based on how many search results are returned. 
 * When a search yields 0 results, a "No results found" message is displayed on the page, and is removed or hidden when students are displayed on the page again.
 * After a search, pages only display students that match the search criteria and pages display the correct number of students.****
